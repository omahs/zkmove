# zkMove

In order to improve the scalability of the blockchain, we propose zkMove - a zero-knowledge proof-based smart contract runtime environment that combines Move, the most secure smart contract programming language, with PLONK, a maturing zero-knowledge proof technology, to "Move" computation from on-chain to off-chain, significantly improving the scalability of blockchain while ensuring security. 

We are nearing completion of the first phase of the POC for the zkMove zero-knowledge proof virtual machine, where non-Turing-complete Move smart contracts can execute correctly and their zk proofs can be generated and verified.
