# zkMove

In order to improve the scalability of public blockchains, we have proposed zkMove - a general purpose blockchain scalability engine, which perfectly combines Move, the next 
generation smart contract programming language, with the most mature zero-knowledge proofs technology PLONK, and “moves” computation from on-chain to off-chain. 
We expect It can greatly improve the scalability of the blockchain without sacrificing security. Detailed description can be found [here](./docs/zkMove_project_description_ch.pdf).
