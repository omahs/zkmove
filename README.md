# zkMove

In order to improve the scalability of the blockchain, we propose zkMove - a zero-knowledge proof-based smart contract runtime environment that combines Move, the most secure smart contract programming language, with PLONK, a maturing zero-knowledge proof technology, to "Move" computation from on-chain to off-chain, significantly improving the scalability of blockchain while ensuring security. Detailed description can be found [here](./docs/zkMove_project_description_en.pdf) [(中文)](./docs/zkMove_project_description_ch.pdf)
